### Initial setup process

1. Follow the steps found at https://laravel.com/docs to install the latest Laravel version.
2. Clone our GitHub repository, and place it over your laravel installation.
3. Run `composer install`
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill required fields. The VATSIM connect demo URI is already placed in there. Get your ID and put your redirect URI into http://auth-dev.vatsim.net.
5. Run `php artisan migrate --seed` (runs database migrations and seeds with required rows).
6. Run `php artisan key:generate`.
7. Login with one of the accounts found at http://wiki.vatsim.net/connect.
8. Give that new account in the `users` table a `permissions` value of `5`.
